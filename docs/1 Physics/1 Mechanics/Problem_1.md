# Problem 1:

# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to deeply explore how the **horizontal range** of a projectile depends on the **launch angle** $\theta$, assuming no air resistance. Although the range equation looks simple, its implications and derivation offer valuable understanding of 2D motion under gravity.

## 2. Motivation & Importance

Projectile motion appears frequently in **engineering, sports, military applications**, and **planetary science**. From designing robotic arms to simulating cannon trajectories or space launchesâ€”mastering this topic equips learners with key analytical tools.

## 3. Theoretical Foundation

### 3.1. Assumptions

To simplify our analysis, we assume:

- The projectile is launched from ground level.
- No air resistance.
- Constant gravitational acceleration ($g \approx 9.81$ m/sÂ²).

---

### 3.2. Key Equations

#### Horizontal and Vertical Components:

If the initial velocity is $v_0$ and the launch angle is $\theta$, the velocity components are:

$$
v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(\theta), \quad v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta)
$$

#### Time of Flight (T):

The projectile returns to the same vertical level when $y(t) = 0$. Using vertical motion:

$$
y(t) = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 \Rightarrow t = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

We take the non-zero solution:

$$
T = \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

#### Range (R):

The horizontal distance traveled during this time is:

$$
R = v_{0x} \cdot T = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot \frac{2v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

$$
\boxed{R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}}
$$

> ðŸ’¡ **Insight**: This equation shows that the range depends on the square of the initial speed and the sine of twice the launch angle.

### 3.3. Implications of the Range Formula

- Maximum range occurs when $\sin(2\theta)$ is maximized â‡’ $2\theta = 90^\circ$ â‡’ $\theta = 45^\circ$.
- $\sin(2\theta)$ is symmetric about $45^\circ$, so **angles like $30^\circ$ and $60^\circ$ produce equal ranges**.
- Larger $v_0$ leads to a longer range.
- Higher $g$ (e.g., on Jupiter) reduces the range.

## 4. Graphical Analysis

Letâ€™s use Python to plot $R$ vs. $\theta$ for different $v_0$ values.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def compute_range(v0, theta_deg, g=9.81):
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta_deg)
    return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta_rad)) / g

angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)
velocities = [10, 20, 30]

plt.figure(figsize=(9, 6))
for v in velocities:
    ranges = [compute_range(v, angle) for angle in angles]
    plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=f'vâ‚€ = {v} m/s')

plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle')
plt.xlabel('Launch Angle Î¸ (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range R (meters)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
